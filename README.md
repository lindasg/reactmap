Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install --save react`

Install dependencies before start.

### `npm start`

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

```
-m http.server 8080
```
In either case navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
